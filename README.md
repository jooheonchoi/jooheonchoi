### Hi there!
My name's Jun (He, Him)!

I'm currently a third year Computer Science student primarily interested in backend development.

Current interests are backend developement and data analysis with Python, as well as full-stack with the MERN stack.

In my spare time, I enjoy following hockey (Canucks), playing piano, and painting (acrylic).
