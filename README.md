### Hi there!
My name's Jun (He, Him)!

I'm currently a third year Computer Science at student primarily interested in backend development
I'm also eager to learn more about Python and full-stack development with Javascript/Node.js/React.

In my spare time, I enjoy following hockey (Canucks), playing piano, and painting (acrylic).

Feel free to reach out to me at choi.jun@outlook.com!
