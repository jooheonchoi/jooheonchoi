### Hi there!
This is Jun in Dec.2020!
I'm currently a third year CS student and eager to learn more, especially about Javascript/Node.js/React and Python.

In my spare time, I enjoy following hockey (Canucks), playing piano, and painting (acrylic).

Feel free to reach out to me at choi.jun@outlook.com!
