### Hi there!
My name's Jun (He, Him)!

I'm currently a third year CS student and eager to learn more, especially about Python and Javascript/Node.js/React.

In my spare time, I enjoy following hockey (Canucks), playing piano, and painting (acrylic).

Feel free to reach out to me at choi.jun@outlook.com!
